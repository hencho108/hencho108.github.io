# Data Science Portfolio by Hendrik Mischo
This repository is a compilation of some of the projects I worked on. The aim of the projects is to derive interesting insights from data and build useful models using data science and machine learning techniques. The projects are written either in R or Python. Click headlines to see analysis and code.

Data: Details of 10k+ apps scraped from Google Play Store 
- Established baseline performance of Logistic Regression model, Random Forest and Boosting
- Tuned all models to find optimal hyperparameters
- Implemented [H2O.ai](https://www.h2o.ai/)'s machine learning platform for faster computing
- Evaluated model performance
- Determined the most important variables that influence high app rating

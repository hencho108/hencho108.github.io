# Data Science Portfolio by [Hendrik Mischo](https://github.com/hendrik-mischo)
This repository is a compilation of some of the projects I worked on. The aim of the projects is to derive interesting insights from data and build useful models using data science and machine learning techniques. The projects are written either in R or Python. Click headlines to see analysis and code.

## [Predicting High Google Play App Ratings](https://hendrik-mischo.github.io/Projects/Google_Apps/Google_Apps.html)
Data: Details of 10k+ apps scraped from Google Play Store
- Established baseline performance of Logistic Regression model, Random Forest and Boosting
- Tuned all models to find optimal hyperparameters
- Implemented [H2O.ai](https://www.h2o.ai/)'s machine learning platform for faster computing
- Evaluated model performance
- Determined the most important variables that influence high app rating

## [Monty Hall Problem Simulation](https://hendrik-mischo.github.io/Projects/Monty_Hall_Simulation/Monty_Hall_Simulation.html)
Recently, I watched the movie "21". In one of the scenes they talk about a famous statistical problem, the Monty Hall problem ([Wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem)). I couldn't believe that it is true, so I ran a simulation to find out myself

# Data Science Portfolio by Hendrik Mischo
This repository is a compilation of some of the projects I worked on.

The aim of the projects is to derive interesting insights from data and build useful models using data science and machine learning techniques.

The projects are typically written in either R or Python.

## [Black Friday: EDA, Spending Prediction and Recommendation System](https://hendrik-mischo.github.io/Projects/Black_Friday/Black_Friday.html)
*Collaboration with classmate [Kelly Raas](https://github.com/kellyraas)*
- Dataset of Black Friday shoppers
- Derived valuable insights about customers and products
- Predicted customer spending comparing Linear Model and Random Forest
- Built a Recommendation System that recommends new products to customers, which they are likely to purchase

## [Predicting High Google Play App Ratings](https://hendrik-mischo.github.io/Projects/Google_Apps/Google_Apps.html)
- Dataset of app ratings and information on Google Play Store 
- Cleaned the data
- Established baseline performance of Logistic Regression model, Random Forest and Boosting
- Tuned all models to find optimal hyperparameters
- Used [H2O.ai](https://www.h2o.ai/)'s machine learning platform for faster computing
- Evaluated model performance
- Determined the most important variables that influence high rating
